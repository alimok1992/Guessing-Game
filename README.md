Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This simple and interactive web-based game was created using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technologies Used:
HTML: The structure of the game is built using HTML, providing the foundation for the content and layout.

CSS: The game's visual styling and layout are implemented using CSS, enhancing the user interface and overall design.

JavaScript: The game logic and interactivity are powered by JavaScript. The random generation of a secret number, handling user input, and updating the game state dynamically are all achieved through JavaScript.

How to Play:
Open the HTML file in your web browser.
The game will generate a random number between 1 and 20.
Enter your guess in the input field and click the "Check" button.
Receive feedback on your guess â€“ whether it's too high, too low, or correct.
Try to guess the correct number with the fewest attempts possible.
Your current score is displayed, and the high score is updated if you beat it.
Click the "Again" button to start a new round.
Enjoy the game and happy guessing!
